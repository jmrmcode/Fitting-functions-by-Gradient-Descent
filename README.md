Fitting a function to data using gradient descent
## What does it do
Fit an arbitrary univariate function to data by gradient descent using [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).

The gradient descent method makes use of the first derivative of the cost function to iteratively find its global minimum. This global minimum corresponds to the parameter value that yields the best fit of the target function to the data.
The code uses the sum of squared errors as the cost function and the periodic univariate function as an example:
